🎨 Colour System

XP Locker uses a dark-themed UI inspired by gaming aesthetics. It emphasises high contrast and clarity.

| Color Role        | Code        | Rationale                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Background| `#0d0d0d`   | Deep black to mimic modern gaming UIs and OLED screens      |
| Accent Purple     | `#6f42c1`   | Adds vibrancy, energy, and gamer-style flair                |
| Button Hover      | `#8a5dff`   | A brighter purple variant for hover interaction feedback    |
| Text              | `#ffffff`   | Crisp white for high readability against dark background    |
| Soft Gray Borders | `#cccccc`   | Gentle separation between content blocks                    |

> 🎯 Design Principle: We followed WCAG contrast guidelines for readability and accessibility.

**📱 Breakpoint Logic**

XP Locker is fully responsive using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries:

| Breakpoint      | Logic                                                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LG` (≥1024px)  | Grid layout with 3 gear cards per row, horizontal nav, and reviews layout   |
| `MD` (≥768px)   | Switches to 3-column grid for gear and accessories                          |
| `SM` (<768px)   | Stacks content vertically for mobile readability                            |
| Footer and navbar layouts also adjust for screen size                                         |

> 💡 We used `@media screen and (max-width: ...)` queries to dynamically control column flow and spacing.
